# Goal of Project
 
With this presentation tool we seek to provide an easy-to-use online application for creating slides. This includes WYSIWYG-editing, presentation-wide styles and the ability to embed videos and sound for the ultimate experience. 

## Our unique selling points

* good set of hotkeys, also, user-definable
* (POTENTIALLY) mobile remote control
* (POSSIBLY) live chat hosted during presentation for questions
* (POSSIBLY) works offline (editing and presenting)
